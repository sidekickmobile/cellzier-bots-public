2. "Analyzing your phone's condition and generating a grade..."
3. **"Generating description based on:** iPhone 12, blue color..."

   - **Explanation**:
     ```
     Based on the information provided, your iPhone 12 receives a C grade
     for fair condition. The screen scratches are a notable cosmetic issue
     that affects the overall grade. However, full functionality suggests
     the device remains usable for daily tasks.
     ```
   - **---**
   - **📋 Checklist**:
     ```
     **1.** What is the battery health percentage?
     **2.** What is the cosmetic condition? Are there any scratches, marks, or dings on the frame/body?
     **3.** What is the repair/replacement history? Have any parts been replaced or repaired?
     ```
   - **Footer**: "Click on Add Missing Info if you want to tell more."
   - **Interactive Button**: [Add Missing Info]
5. "Your description is ready! You can close this thread when you're done."

### Example 3: Add Missing Information Flow

**User Input**: Clicks "Add Missing Info" button after Example 2

**Bot Response**:
1. Modal opens with title "Add Missing Information"
2. **Text Input**:
   - Label: "Additional Information"
   - Placeholder: "Please provide details about: battery health percentage, cosmetic condition, repair history"

**User Submits Modal**:
```
Battery health is 78%. Back has a few small dings on the corners.
No repairs done, all original parts.
```

**Bot Response**:
1. "Updated Grade with Additional Information:" (ephemeral)
2. **"Generating description based on:** iPhone 12, blue color. Screen works fine but has some scratches. Phone works okay overall.
Additional notes: Battery health is 78%. Back has a few small dings on the corners. No repairs done, all original parts.
3. **📱 Phone Grade: B (Good Condition)** (Blue embed):
   - **Explanation**:
     ```
     With the additional information, your iPhone 12 receives an upgraded B grade
     for good condition. The 78% battery health is acceptable for the device age,
     and while there are cosmetic issues including screen scratches and corner dings,
     the fact that all parts are original and no repairs were needed indicates
     solid build quality and reasonable care.
     ```
4. (No missing information section since all key details provided)

### Example 4: Question Detection and Poor Condition

**User Input**:
```
iPhone 11 with cracked screen and bad battery. Maybe 60% battery health?
Is this worth fixing or should I just sell it as-is?
```

**Bot Response**:
1. ✅ reaction on message
2. "Analyzing your phone's condition and generating a grade..."
3. **📱 Phone Grade: D (Poor Condition)** (Red embed):
   - **Explanation**:
     ```
     Your iPhone 11 receives a D grade due to significant issues. The cracked
     screen is a major cosmetic and potentially functional problem, while the
     60% battery health indicates replacement is needed soon. These issues
     substantially impact the device's value and usability.
     ```
   - **---**
   - **❓ Answer to Your Question**:
     ```
     Given the cracked screen and poor battery health, repair costs may exceed
     the device's post-repair value. Consider selling as-is for parts/repair
     unless you plan to keep it long-term. Screen and battery replacement
     together could cost $200-300, while the device might only be worth
     $250-350 after repairs.
     ```

### Example 5: Minimal Input with Extensive Missing Information

**User Input**:
```
old phone, works
```

**Bot Response**:
1. ✅ reaction on message
2. "Analyzing your phone's condition and generating a grade..."
3. **📱 Phone Grade: C (Fair Condition)** (Orange embed):
   - **Explanation**:
     ```
     Based on the very limited information provided, a conservative C grade
     is assigned. While the device reportedly works, the lack of specific
     details about condition, model, and other factors prevents a more
     accurate assessment.
     ```
   - **---**
   - **📋 Checklist**:
     ```
     **1.** What is the battery health percentage?
     **2.** What is the cosmetic condition? Are there any scratches, marks, or dings on the frame/body?
     **3.** What is the screen condition? Are there any scratches or cracks?
     **4.** What is the repair/replacement history? Have any parts been replaced or repaired?
     ```
