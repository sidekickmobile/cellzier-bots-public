# Market Evaluator Discord Bot Flow

## Overview

The Market Evaluator feature is a Discord bot functionality that provides users with accurate market value estimates for their devices through a guided thread-based interaction. The bot uses AI for device analysis and integrates with backend market data APIs to provide current pricing estimates based on real marketplace data from eBay and other platforms.

## Backend Integration

The bot integrates with the backend market data API for real-time pricing information:

- **Backend API URL**: Environment variable `BACKEND_URL`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/market-data/`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves current market pricing data from eBay and marketplace listings
- **Data Source**: Real-time scraping and analysis of marketplace listings
- **Parameters**: Device model, storage capacity, and condition grade (optional)

## Permission Requirements

- Available to all users (no premium access required)
- No specific role restrictions for market evaluator functionality
