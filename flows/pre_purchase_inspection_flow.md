# Pre Purchase Inspection Discord Bot Flow

## Overview

The Pre Purchase Inspection feature is a Discord bot functionality that allows users to receive pricing quotes for devices they're considering purchasing through a guided thread-based interaction. The bot uses AI and device catalog integration via the Management Hub to analyze device descriptions and provide three pricing scenarios: AS IS purchase, FIXED purchase, and repair service options.

## Management Hub Integration

The bot integrates with the Cellzier Management Hub, a web-based dashboard that provides device catalog management and pricing data:

- **Management Hub URL**: `https://zrlwzphylf.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/admin/devices`
- **Purpose**: Centralized device catalog with pricing tiers and fault repair cost data
- **Data Source**: Contains device models, condition-based pricing, and repair cost estimates
- **Access**: Backend API integration for real-time pricing retrieval

## Permission Requirements

- Only users with premium access (role ID: 1324737846371815435) can use this feature

## Flow Description

### 1. Initial Trigger

- User visits the **üîç‚îÇ·¥ò Ä·¥á-·¥ò·¥ú Ä·¥Ñ ú·¥Äs·¥á- ô·¥è·¥õ** channel (ID: 1366386818311782441)
- Bot displays a welcome message with action buttons including "üí∞ Pre Purchase Inspection"

### 2. Permission Check

- When user clicks "üí∞ Pre Purchase Inspection" button, the bot performs permission validation:
  - Checks if user is bot owner (automatic access)
  - If not owner, validates premium role membership
  - If no premium access, displays premium required message and stops

### 3. Thread Creation

- Bot creates a private thread named `{username}'s Pre Purchase Inspection`
- Thread auto-archives after 60 minutes of inactivity
- Bot responds with ephemeral message containing clickable link to the thread

### 4. Guidance Display

- Bot posts welcome message in the thread mentioning the user
- Displays guidance embed with blue color (0x3498db) containing:
  - **Title**: "Pre Purchase Inspection Guidance"
  - **Description**: Instructions for providing device information
  - **Footer**: "Type your details in this thread. I'll process your message automatically."

### 5. Device Information Collection

- User types their device description including condition and any known issues
- Bot validates:
  - Message is from thread owner (original user)
  - Thread is in "collecting" status
- Bot adds ‚úÖ reaction to acknowledge message receipt
- Bot stores message in thread tracking data

### 6. Pricing Analysis Process

#### 6.1 Processing Initiation
- Bot displays: "Analyzing your device information and generating pricing quote..."
- Bot combines all user messages into comprehensive device description

#### 6.2 AI Device Information Extraction
- Uses AI to extract structured device information:
  - Brand identification (Apple, Samsung, etc.)
  - Model identification (iPhone 15 Pro, Galaxy S24, etc.)
  - Storage capacity (128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB)
  - Color (if mentioned)
  - Current condition assessment
  - Specific faults and issues mentioned

#### 6.3 Device Catalog Search
- Searches backend device catalog using extracted information via Management Hub API
- **API Endpoint**: `https://zrlwzphylf.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/admin/devices`
- Attempts to find matching device with pricing data from the management dashboard
- Retrieves condition-based pricing tiers and fault repair costs stored in the hub
- Accesses comprehensive fault data for each device model including:
  - Screen replacement costs
  - Battery replacement costs
  - Back glass repair costs
  - Camera repair costs
  - Speaker/audio repair costs
  - Logic board repair costs
- Handles catalog connection errors and device not found scenarios

#### 6.4 Condition Assessment
- Uses AI to assess device condition against standard tiers:
  - **Brand New**: Perfect condition, no issues
  - **New**: Excellent condition, minimal signs of use
  - **Working**: Good condition, fully functional with minor cosmetic issues
  - **Faulty**: Has issues but may be repairable
  - **Dead**: Not working, significant repair needed
  - **Damaged Functional**: Physical damage but still works
  - **Damaged Non-Functional**: Physical damage and doesn't work

#### 6.5 Pricing Calculations
- Calculates three pricing scenarios:
  1. **AS IS Price**: Current condition value from catalog
  2. **FIXED Price**: Working condition value minus estimated repair costs
  3. **Repair Service Cost**: Repair estimate plus 30% service markup

### 7. Response Delivery

#### 7.1 Initial Response
- Displays: "**Based on your description:** {user_device_description}"

#### 7.2 Main Pricing Embed (Color varies by condition)
**Device Information Section:**
- Brand, model, storage capacity
- Assessed condition tier

**Pricing Scenarios:**
- **üíµ Sell to Us AS IS**: Immediate purchase price in current condition
- **üîß Sell to Us FIXED**: Price after user repairs device (includes repair cost estimate)
- **üõ†Ô∏è Our Repair Service**: Cost for professional repair service

**AI Assessment (if available):**
- Detailed reasoning for condition assessment and pricing

**Footer**: "Prices are estimates and subject to physical inspection by our team."

#### 7.3 Interactive Elements
- View with additional actions for refined quotes or follow-up questions

### 8. Follow-up Interaction Support

- Thread remains open for additional questions and clarifications
- Users can provide more details to refine pricing estimates
- Bot encourages follow-up: "üí¨ Feel free to ask any follow-up questions or provide additional information to refine the quote."
- **Improved Follow-up Handling**:
  - Bot automatically detects follow-up messages vs initial messages
  - Follow-up messages trigger refined quote generation with message "Analyzing your additional information and updating the quote..."
  - All previous messages are combined for comprehensive analysis
  - Thread status is properly reset to continue accepting messages

### 9. Error Handling

- **Device catalog unavailable**: Shows connection error with retry suggestion
- **Device not found**: Provides general pricing guidance
- **AI extraction errors**: Falls back to basic device information structure
- **Pricing calculation errors**: Shows error message with manual assessment offer

## Current Limitations

1. **Catalog Dependency**: Requires Management Hub API service for accurate pricing
2. **AI Accuracy**: Device information extraction may not be 100% accurate
3. **Estimation Only**: All prices are estimates subject to physical inspection
4. **Limited Device Support**: Only devices in Management Hub catalog receive accurate pricing
5. **Network Dependency**: Requires stable connection to Management Hub backend services
6. **No Image Analysis**: Cannot analyze uploaded photos of device condition
7. **Market Price Fluctuation**: Prices may not reflect current market conditions
8. **Hub-based Repair Estimates**: Repair costs come from Management Hub data, not live service quotes
9. **No Warranty Integration**: Cannot account for remaining warranty value
10. **Memory Storage Only**: No persistent storage of quotes or user preferences
11. **Single Device Analysis**: Cannot compare multiple devices in one quote
12. **No Authentication**: Cannot link quotes to user accounts for tracking
13. **Management Hub Availability**: Feature depends on Management Hub API uptime and accessibility
